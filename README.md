## Technical Architecture

### Data Sources

**Real-time Price Data:**
- Primary: Coinbase WebSocket (`wss://ws-feed.exchange.coinbase.com`)
- Fallback: Coinbase REST API polling (activates after 3.5s WebSocket silence)

**Historical Data:**
- Coinbase candle API for initial load:
  - 30d: 6-hour candles
  - 24h/12h/8h: 5-minute candles
  - 1h/10m/5m/1m: 1-minute candles

**24h Statistics:**
- Coinbase Stats API for BTC 24h change
- Coinbase Stats API for ETH, XRP, ADA prices

**Gold Price:**
- TwelveData API (API key: `830bdfca25d44bfe9992c9872d0693f5`)

**News Feeds:**
- RSS feeds via rss2json.com CORS proxy

### Data Management

**Sampling Strategy:**
- Different sample rates per timeframe to optimize performance
- 30d: 1-hour intervals
- 24h: 5-minute intervals
- 10m: 0.5-second intervals
- 1m: 0.1-second intervals

**Volume Tracking:**
- All trades captured (no sampling) for accurate volume calculations
- Time-binned volume bars with locked boundaries for short timeframes

**Top Trades Persistence:**
- Firebase Realtime Database stores top buys/sells
- Only 1h+ timeframes persisted (10m/5m/1m too volatile)
- Prevents duplicate saves during initial load via `isLoadingFromFirebase` flag

---

## Known Issues

### Trump Truth Feed Challenge
- **Issue:** Trump Truth RSS feed fetches items but they may not appear in news list
- **Cause:** Many recent posts are re-truths (shares), which have "[No Title]" prefix and get filtered out
- **Debug:** Enhanced logging added (v13.15) to show filter behavior
- **Status:** Monitoring - works when original posts are available

### Firebase Real-Time Sync
- **Issue:** Real-time listeners caused infinite update loops
- **Temporary Fix:** Listeners disabled (line 1666)
- **Impact:** Top trades persist on page load but don't sync in real-time across tabs
- **Future:** Need debouncing or change detection to prevent save loops

### RSS2JSON Rate Limits
- Free tier may have rate limits
- News feed updates every 3 minutes (could hit limits with multiple users)

---

## Settings & Configuration

### User Settings (localStorage)
Settings stored in `btcStalkerSettings`:
```javascript
{
  theme: 'dark' | 'light',
  charts: {
    '30d': boolean,
    '24h': boolean,
    // ... etc
    'news': boolean
  },
  alerts: {
    volSpike: boolean,  // Volume spike flash alerts
    tradeBlink: boolean // Large trade yellow flash
  }
}
```

### Default Visible Charts
- 24h, 8h, 1h, 5m, News Feed

### Alert Thresholds
- **Volume Spike:** 1.5x average volume
- **Large Trade Blink:** All trades in top 10/13 list

---

## Development Notes

### Why Separate Arrays?
- `win30d`, `win24h`, etc.: Sampled price data for charts
- `win30dVol`, `win24hVol`, etc.: All trades for accurate volume
- `win30dLive`, `win24hLive`, etc.: Live trades for top trades list (NOT time-windowed)

### Why Live Arrays Aren't Pruned?
The "Live" arrays (win30dLive, etc.) hold the historical high scores (top trades) that persist via Firebase. They're intentionally not pruned by time window - they accumulate the biggest trades seen over the session/Firebase history.

### Chart Drawing Performance
- Canvas uses device pixel ratio for crisp rendering (capped at 3x)
- Throttled resize handler prevents excessive redraws
- 2-minute default timeout for bash commands

---

## Files in Repository

- `index.html` - Main production dashboard (current)
- `mobile.html` - Mobile-optimized version
- `m.html` - Mobile version (duplicate)
- `staging.html` - Staging/test version
- `old.html` - Previous version backup
- `desktop.html.backup` - Desktop version backup
- `btc-test-simple.html` - Simple test file
- `CNAME` - GitHub Pages custom domain config

---

## Future Improvements

### High Priority
- Fix Firebase real-time sync (add proper debouncing)
- Improve Trump Truth feed reliability (maybe direct API instead of RSS)
- Add rate limit handling for RSS2JSON

### Nice to Have
- Export top trades as CSV
- Alert notifications (browser notifications API)
- Historical price range selector
- Custom alert thresholds in Settings
- Mobile responsive improvements
- WebSocket reconnection improvements

---

## Deployment

**Platform:** GitHub Pages
**Branch:** main
**Auto-deploy:** Enabled (pushes to main deploy automatically)

To deploy changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push origin main
```

---

## Development Workflow

### Version Bump Process

**IMPORTANT:** After EVERY change to index.html, follow this process:

1. **Update version number** in TWO places:
   - Line 6: `<title>BTC Stalker - Multi-Timeframe vX.XX</title>`
   - Line 162: `<span class="pill" style="opacity:.6">vX.XX</span>`

2. **Update README.md**:
   - Line 5: `**Current Version:** vX.XX`
   - Add entry to "Recent Changes" section with bullet points of what changed

3. **Commit with descriptive message**:
   ```bash
   git add index.html README.md
   git commit -m "Descriptive message of changes"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Version Numbering
- **Major changes** (new features, major UI changes): Increment first decimal (13.x â†’ 14.0)
- **Minor changes** (bug fixes, small tweaks, config changes): Increment second decimal (13.15 â†’ 13.16)

### Claude Code Instructions
When working with Claude Code, remind at start of session:
> "Please update version numbers in index.html (title + UI pill) and commit after every change"

Or add to each request:
> "Update version and commit when done"

## Troubleshooting

### "Connecting..." stuck
- Check browser console for WebSocket errors
- Verify Coinbase API is accessible
- Should auto-fallback to REST API after 3.5 seconds

### News feed not loading
- Check console for RSS fetch errors
- rss2json.com may be rate limited
- Individual feeds may be temporarily down

### Charts not updating
- Check WebSocket connection status (bottom-left pill)
- Verify Firebase connection in console
- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Top trades disappeared
- Check Firebase console for data
- `isLoadingFromFirebase` flag may be stuck (check console)
- Try refreshing page
